# 🧬 AI-Optimized PCOD Prognosis & Classification System

An intelligent healthcare analytics system that predicts and classifies Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) risk using machine learning and patient health parameters.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project?
PCOD affects millions of women globally, often remaining undiagnosed. This system aims to support early risk identification and clinical decision-making using AI-driven insights.

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- PCOD Risk Prediction (Yes / No)
- Severity Classification (Low / Moderate / High)
- Machine Learning Model Comparison
- Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- Health Recommendation Insights
- Accuracy & Performance Metrics

---


**Workflow:**
1. Patient data input  
2. Data preprocessing & normalization  
3. ML model prediction  
4. Risk classification & recommendations

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
| Model | Accuracy |
|-----|--------|
| Logistic Regression |
| Random Forest |

✔ Random Forest performed better due to non-linear pattern handling.
